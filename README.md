# Intrinio Java SDK for Real-Time Stock Prices
SDK for working with Intrinio's realtime Multi-Exchange prices feed.  Intrinioâ€™s Multi-Exchange feed bridges the gap by merging real-time equity pricing from the IEX and MEMX exchanges. Get a comprehensive view with increased market volume and enjoy no exchange fees, no per-user requirements, no permissions or authorizations, and little to no paperwork.

[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time stock prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/real-time-multi-exchange) and follow the instructions below.

## Requirements

- Java 14+

## Installation

Go to [Release](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-java-sdk/releases/), download the JAR, reference it in your project. The JAR contains dependencies necessary to the SDK.

## Sample Project

For a sample Java project see: [intrinio-realtime-java-sdk](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-java-sdk)

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time price quotes (last trade, bid, ask)
* Subscribe to updates from individual securities
* Subscribe to updates for all securities

## Example Usage
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
		Client.Log("Starting sample app");
		TradeHandler tradeHandler = new TradeHandler();
		QuoteHandler quoteHandler = new QuoteHandler();
		Client client = new Client(tradeHandler, quoteHandler);
		Timer timer = new Timer();
		TimerTask task = new TimerTask() {
			public void run() {
				Client.Log(client.getStats());
				tradeHandler.tryLog();
				quoteHandler.tryLog();
			}
		};
		timer.schedule(task, 10000, 10000);
		client.join(); //Load symbols from config.json
		//client.join(new String[] {"AAPL", "GOOG", "MSFT"}, false); //specify symbols at runtime
	}
```

## Handling Quotes

There are thousands of securities, each with their own feed of activity.  We highly encourage you to make your trade and quote handlers has short as possible and follow a queue pattern so your app can handle the volume of activity.

## Data Format

### Trade Message

```java
public record Trade(String symbol, double price, long size, long timestamp, long totalVolume)
```

* **symbol** - Ticker symbole.
* **price** - the price in USD
* **size** - the size of the last trade.
* **totalVolume** - The number of stocks traded so far today for this symbol.
* **timestamp** - a Unix timestamp in nanoseconds since unix epoch.
