# Intrinio Java SDK for Real-Time Stock and Forex Prices

[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time stock and forex prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/marketplace/data/prices/realtime) and follow the instructions below.

## Requirements

- Java 7+

## Installation

Go to [Release](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-java-sdk/releases), download the JAR, reference it in your project. The JAR contains dependencies necessary to the SDK.

## Sample Project

For a sample Java project see: [intrinio-realtime-java-sample](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-java-sample)

For a sample Android project see: [intrinio-realtime-android-sample](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-android-sample)

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time price quotes (last trade, bid, ask)
* Subscribe to updates from individual securities or forex pairs
* Subscribe to updates for all securities or forex pairs

## Example Usage
```java
String api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

try (RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(api_key, RealTimeClient.Provider.IEX)) {
    client.registerQuoteHandler(new QuoteHandler() {
        public void onQuote(Quote quote) {
            System.out.println(quote.toString());
        }
    });

    String[] channels = new String[]{"AAPL", "MSFT", "GE"};
    client.join(channels);

    client.connect();
}
```

## Handling Quotes and the Queue

When the Intrinio Realtime library receives quotes from the websocket connection, it places them in an internal queue. This queue has a default maximum size of 10,000 quotes. You can modify this value by specifying a `maxQueueSize` parameter in the client constructor, as your environment memory contraints allow. Once a quote has been placed in the queue, a registered `QuoteHandler` will receive it and pass it along to its `onQuote` method. Your overriden `onQuote` method should process quotes quickly, so that the queue does not reach its maximum size (at which point, the system will log an error and ignore any incoming quotes until the queue has space). We recommend registering multiple `QuoteHandler` instances for operations such as writing quotes to a database (or anything else involving time-consuming I/O). The client also has a `remainingQueueCapacity()` method, which returns an integer specifying the approximate length of the quote queue. Monitor this to make sure you are processing quotes quickly enough.

## Providers

Currently, Intrinio offers realtime data for this SDK from the following providers:

* IEX - [Homepage](https://iextrading.com/)
* QUODD - [Homepage](http://home.quodd.com/)
* FXCM - [Homepage](https://www.fxcm.com/)


Each has distinct price channels and quote formats, but a very similar API.

## Quote Data Format

Each data provider has a different format for their quote data.

### QUODD

NOTE: Messages from QUOOD reflect _changes_ in market data. Not all fields will be present in every message. Upon subscribing to a channel, you will receive one quote and one trade message containing all fields of the latest data available.

## Channels

### QUODD

To receive price quotes from QUODD, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker with data feed designation (`AAPL.NB`, `MSFT.NB`, `GE.NB`, etc)

### IEX

To receive price quotes from IEX, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker (`AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GE`, etc)
* The security lobby (`$lobby`) where all price quotes for all securities are posted
* The security last price lobby (`$lobby_last_price`) where only last price quotes for all securities are posted

Special access is required for both lobby channels. [Contact us](mailto:sales@intrinio.com) for more information.

### FXCM

To receive price quotes from FXCM, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be

* `fxcm:pair:{pair_code}` - the fx currency pair channel where price updates for the provided currency pair are posted (i.e. `fxcm:pair:EUR/USD`)
* `fxcm:base:{currency_code}` - the fx currency channel where prices updates for any fx currency pair that has the provided currency as the base currency (i.e. `fxcm:base:EUR` would post prices from EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, etc.)
* `fxcm:quote:{currency_code}` - the fx currency channel where prices updates for any fx currency pair that has the provided currency as the quote currency (i.e. `fxcm:quote:USD` would post prices from EUR/USD, JPY/USD, etc.)

The Intrinio REST API provides a listing of pairs, currencies, and their corresponding codes:

* [FX Currencies](https://docs.intrinio.com/documentation/download/currencies)
* [FX Currency Pairs](https://docs.intrinio.com/documentation/download/currency_pairs)

## API Keys

You will receive your Intrinio API Key after [creating an account](https://intrinio.com/signup). You will need a subscription to a [realtime data feed](https://intrinio.com/marketplace/data/prices/realtime) as well.

## Documentation

### Methods

`RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(String api_key, RealTimeClient.Provider provider)` - Creates an Intrinio Real-Time client
* **Parameter** `api_key`: Your Intrinio API Key
* **Parameter** `provider`: The real-time data provider to use

```java
String api_key = "YOUR_INTRINIO_API_KEY";

RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(api_key, RealTimeClient.Provider.IEX);
```

---------

`RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(String api_key, RealTimeClient.Provider provider, Integer maxQueueSize)` - Creates an Intrinio Real-Time client
* **Parameter** `api_key`: Your Intrinio API Key
* **Parameter** `provider`: The real-time data provider to use
* **Parameter** `maxQueueSize`: The maximum size of the quote queue (default size is 10,000)

```java
String api_key = "YOUR_INTRINIO_API_KEY";
Integer maxQueueSize = 50000;

RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(api_key, RealTimeClient.Provider.IEX, maxQueueSize);
```

---------

`client.connect()` - Opens the WebSocket connection and joins the requested channels. This method blocks indefinitely.

---------

`client.connectAsync()` - Opens the WebSocket connection and joins the requested channels. This method returns after a connection has been established.

---------

`client.disconnect()` - Closes the WebSocket.

---------

`client.close()` - Closes the WebSocket, and disposes all internal resources. You _must_ either call this to dispose of the client or use try-with-resource.

---------

`client.registerQuoteHandler(QuoteHandler quoteHandler)` - Adds a QuoteHandler for handling quotes. Each quote handler will wait to receive a quote from the client's queue. Note that all quote handlers will not receive all quotes. Each handler receives the next quote in the queue once the handler finishes handling its current quote. Register multiple quote handlers to handle quotes quicker in cases of I/O.

```java
client.registerQuoteHandler(new QuoteHandler() {
    public void onQuote(Quote quote) {
        // do something with the quote
    }
});
```

Or with Java 8 lambdas:

```java
client.registerQuoteHandler(quote ->
    // do something with quote
);
```

---------

`client.getNextQuote()` - Blocks until the queue provides the next quote, then returns the quote.

---------

`client.remainingQueueCapacity()` - Returns the remaining queue capacity. Check this periodically to make sure you are processing quotes quickly enough.

---------

`client.join(String channel)` - Joins the given channel. This can be called at any time. The client will automatically register joined channels and establish the proper subscriptions with the WebSocket connection.
* **Parameter** `channel` - The channel to join

```java
client.join("AAPL");
```

---------

`client.join(String[] channels)` - Joins the given channels.
* **Parameter** `channels` - The channels to join

```java
client.join(new String[]{"AAPL", "MSFT"});
```

---------

`client.leave(String channel)` - Leaves the given channel.
* **Parameter** `channel` - The channel to leave

```java
client.leave("AAPL");
```

---------

`client.leave(String[] channels)` - Leaves the given channels.
* **Parameter** `channel` - The channels to leave

```java
client.leave(new String[]{"AAPL", "MSFT"});
```

---------

`client.leaveAll()` - Leaves all channels.

---------

`client.setChannels(String[] channels)` - Joins/leaves channels so that only the given channels are joined.
* **Parameter** `channels` - The only channels to join

```java
client.setChannels(new String[]{"AAPL", "MSFT"});
```

---------

`client.setLogger(Logger logger)` - Replaces the internal logger with the provided java.util.logging.Logger instance.
* **Parameter** `logger` - A java.util.logging.Logger instance
